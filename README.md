# BloodDriveDatabase
Database designed and built from scratch

Designed an entity relational diagram with correct crowâ€™s foot notation and foreign key references to create a database
for blood donation centers and related medical facilities using Microsoft SQL Server
Implemented error-handling and control of flow within user-defined functions, computed columns and nested stored
procedures to ensure efficiency and prevent cascading rollbacks
Utilized Tableau to develop data visualizations showcasing data inserted through synthetic transactions and self-cleaned
data stored in an Excel spreadsheet

## After a few iterations of designing an ERD and changing the connections between tables we ended up with this design:

## Once we implemented the Create Table code it turned into this visual in Microsoft SQL Server:

## Using the Dummy Data we implemented we came up with a few visualizations using Tableau:
