# BloodDriveDatabase
Database designed and built from scratch

Designed an entity relational diagram with correct crowâ€™s foot notation and foreign key references to create a database
for blood donation centers and related medical facilities using Microsoft SQL Server
Implemented error-handling and control of flow within user-defined functions, computed columns and nested stored
procedures to ensure efficiency and prevent cascading rollbacks
Utilized Tableau to develop data visualizations showcasing data inserted through synthetic transactions and self-cleaned
data stored in an Excel spreadsheet
